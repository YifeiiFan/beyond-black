    <h2>5. Spiritual Structure: A Third Presence</h2>

    <p>The second structure is spiritual: the way religious solitude is lived as an event in a relationship with an unseen Other.</p>
  
    <p>In contemporary loneliness, the central feeling is often: <strong>no one sees me</strong>. Messages are left on read; invitations do not arrive; one’s presence seems to make little difference. Over time it is easy to drift toward a larger conviction that nothing in reality is especially concerned with one’s existence.</p>
  
    <p>Religious solitude, at least potentially, opens another possibility: that even when no human being is present, one still lives <strong>before a gaze</strong>. The names differ—God, the divine, ultimate reality—but structurally the claim is similar: there is an addressee whose regard matters.</p>
  
    <p>This is not just pious language. A recent cross-national study of five major religions in twenty-two countries found that people who believed that God cares about and loves them reported less loneliness and social isolation than those who did not, even after controlling for ordinary social support (Wormley et al.). The buffering effect of feeling cared for by God was especially strong among those who were objectively socially isolated (Wormley et al.).</p>
  
    <p>This does not mean that religious solitude is automatically comforting. Much religious literature centres on God’s silence, absence, or hiddenness. The crucial point is that this absence is still understood <strong>within</strong> a relationship frame: “Why are you silent?” “Why have you hidden your face?” The pain is interpreted as tension within a relationship, not as proof that no relationship exists.</p>
  
    <p>Spiritually, then, depth appears when the map of reality includes more than the visible social field. A person may still grieve the lack of human intimacy. But that grief is carried before a third presence who is addressed, accused, thanked, or simply acknowledged. “Nobody sees me” is no longer the final description of the situation.</p>
