      <h2>1. What Kind of “Depth” Are We Talking About?</h2>
    
      <p>Many people know this difference intuitively. Two people are alone in their rooms. From the outside the scenes are almost identical: one body, one chair, a closed door. But from the inside they are not the same.</p>
    
      <p>In one room, the air feels thin. Time moves slowly. Thoughts spiral around the same questions: Why is no one answering me? Am I forgettable, unnecessary, already left behind?</p>
    
      <p>In the other room, the same physical solitude feels oddly full. The person is also alone and also quiet, but the silence is experienced as an opening: time to pray, to pay attention, to ask questions that cannot be asked in conversation. The experience may still hurt, but it feels oriented rather than directionless.</p>
    
      <p>This is more than just “religious people are more optimistic.” The real question is structural:</p>
    
      <blockquote>
        <p>What makes some experiences of being alone feel “deep,” while many forms of contemporary loneliness feel thin, fragmented, or simply painful?</p>
        <p>Why does religious solitude so often get described as richer and more generative than the usual psychological loneliness of modern life?</p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>In contemporary psychology, <em>loneliness</em> is usually defined as the subjective feeling that one’s social needs are not being met, together with the distress that follows from this perception—a form of “social pain” (Cacioppo and Patrick). It is like hunger: a signal produced by systems that monitor how safely we are embedded in social life. Chronic loneliness keeps the brain in a state of alert and is linked to health problems across the body (Cacioppo and Patrick).</p>
    
      <p>Yet religious traditions often speak of <em>solitude</em> in very different terms. A person is just as alone, and yet that time is remembered as deep, meaningful, even necessary for their spiritual life.</p>
    
      <p>The basic claim of this essay is that the “depth” of religious solitude comes not from a special spiritual essence, but from the fact that it is placed inside a <strong>richer structure</strong>:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>a psychological structure</strong>, where inner dialogue is kept alive and organised as prayer or reflection rather than collapsing into self-attack;</li>
        <li><strong>a spiritual structure</strong>, where solitude is understood as happening before an unseen Other, not in a purely empty space;</li>
        <li><strong>a temporal structure</strong>, where solitude is embedded in long rhythms and stories, rather than treated as a meaningless gap between social events.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>To see this more clearly, we can first sketch what contemporary loneliness often looks like.</p>

      <h2>2. Contemporary Loneliness: Strong Feelings, Shallow Structure</h2>
    
      <p>Picture an ordinary night. The light is off. Someone is lying in bed. The only glow in the room comes from a phone screen. They scroll through photos, chats, memes, and videos. For a while the stream creates a thin sense of connection: proof that life is happening somewhere, that many people exist out there, doing things together.</p>
    
      <p>Eventually the phone is put down. The darkness in the room suddenly feels heavier, as if a short, weak anesthetic had worn off.</p>
    
      <p>From a social neuroscience perspective, this is not a trivial mood. Chronic loneliness keeps people in a state of <strong>heightened vigilance</strong>: sleep becomes lighter, and ambiguous cues are more easily interpreted as rejection. Over time, lonely people show higher stress, greater inflammation, cognitive decline, and increased mortality (Cacioppo and Patrick).</p>
    
      <p>But from a structural perspective, this kind of loneliness is shallow in at least three ways.</p>
    
      <p><strong>Relationally</strong>, the structure is “me versus the field.” The person is not relating to a small number of enduring, thick ties; they are facing a shifting field of content curated by algorithms and strangers’ attention. It is hard to locate a stable place for oneself inside this space.</p>
    
      <p><strong>Symbolically</strong>, the situation is under-resourced. Our public language for loneliness is thin. We have self-diagnoses (“I have social anxiety,” “I’m bad at people”) and self-deprecating jokes (“doomscrolling again”), but few shared forms for telling this story in a serious way. There is no widely recognised script for what this kind of night means, beyond personal failure or vague cultural clichés.</p>
    
      <p><strong>Temporally</strong>, the experience is compressed into an endless sequence of present moments. The feed is always refreshing; nights blur together. It is hard to say when this loneliness started or what it might be for. It appears less like a phase in a journey and more like a state that could simply repeat forever.</p>
    
      <p>So contemporary loneliness is not weak. It can be excruciating. What makes it shallow is not the lack of pain but the lack of structure: there is very little relational, symbolic, or temporal architecture to hold the pain or make sense of it. It is intense, but hard to narrate as anything more than another bad night.</p>

      <h2>3. What Do We Mean by “Depth”?</h2>
    
      <p>Before we turn to religious solitude, it helps to be clearer about the metaphor of depth itself.</p>
    
      <p>One mistake is to treat depth as a <strong>personal essence</strong>: some people are “deep,” others are superficial. Another is to equate depth with a particular mood—usually some mixture of sadness, seriousness, and introspection.</p>
    
      <p>Here, depth is understood not as a substance inside certain individuals but as a <strong>property of structure</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>An experience is deep when it is:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>relationally layered</strong> – it involves more than one relationship at once;</li>
        <li><strong>symbolically rich</strong> – it can be spoken about in more than one register (psychological, moral, spiritual, communal);</li>
        <li><strong>temporally extended</strong> – it can be placed not only in the moment but also in a personal story and in some larger narrative horizon.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>By contrast, an experience is shallow when it is confined to a single relational frame (“nobody needs me”), a narrow vocabulary (“I’m the problem”), and a thin sense of time (“this is just the way things are now”).</p>
    
      <p>Hannah Arendt offers a helpful distinction here. Writing about loneliness and totalitarianism, she distinguishes between <em>loneliness</em>, in which a person is deserted by others and by themselves, and <em>solitude</em>, in which a person can still carry on an inner dialogue—a “two-in-one” conversation with themselves (Arendt). The danger, for Arendt, is not simply being without others, but losing this inner companion.</p>
    
      <p>Many forms of religious solitude build on this two-in-one and add a third term. The solitary person does not only speak within themselves; they also address an Other—God, or some ultimate reality. The question “What should I do with my life?” is not only posed inward but also outward and upward. The structure becomes triadic: <strong>self – inner companion – divine addressee</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>This is one way in which depth begins to appear. The same felt loneliness is now connected simultaneously to oneself, to an inner dialogue, and to a third presence that is addressed, even if silently.</p>

      <h2>4. Psychological Structure: Turning Inner Monologue into Prayer</h2>
    
      <p>Psychologically, one of the most important differences between everyday loneliness and religious solitude lies in what happens to inner speech.</p>
    
      <p>In many lonely states, inner speech turns against the self. The voice in the head is either blank or hostile: there is nothing to say, or there is only accusation. The person replays perceived mistakes, awkward moments, and imagined judgments. Being alone with oneself feels cramped and unpleasant. It makes sense to reach for noise and distraction.</p>
    
      <p>In religious solitude, inner speech is deliberately <strong>re-shaped</strong>. Instead of a free-floating monologue, it is framed as prayer, meditation, or reflection “before God.” The content may be gratitude, confession, complaint, or simple sharing, but structurally the speech has a form: “You… I…”</p>
    
      <p>Thomas Merton, writing from monastic life, insists that real solitude is not a flight from relationship but a different way of being in it. The solitary is most alone, he says, when they are most exposed to the gaze of God; in that gaze, fear of being seen and the desire to be seen are both drawn out (Merton). Solitude becomes a place where the inner life is allowed to appear, not something that must be covered over.</p>
    
      <p>This reorganisation of inner speech matters in at least two ways.</p>
    
      <p>First, it <strong>keeps inner dialogue from collapsing</strong>. Even when God feels absent, the act of addressing presupposes a listener. This resists the slide into Arendt’s deserted self, in which one no longer feels accompanied even by one’s own thoughts (Arendt).</p>
    
      <p>Second, it <strong>borrows the language of tradition</strong>. Religious communities provide psalms, prayers, and narratives that can be taken up as one’s own words. Someone who feels abandoned can pray, “Why have you forsaken me?” and know that this sentence is not merely their private complaint but part of a long, shared repertoire. Research on “positive solitude” suggests that when people have meaningful frameworks for their time alone—creative, reflective, or spiritual—they are more likely to experience solitude as peaceful rather than distressing (Shiovitz-Ezra and Rozen).</p>
    
      <p>In this sense, the psychological depth of religious solitude lies in the fact that loneliness is not simply suppressed or turned into self-blame. It is given a <strong>form of speech</strong>, addressed to Someone, in continuity with the words of others.</p>

      <a href="#index-title" class="back">← Back to index</a>
      <h2>5. Spiritual Structure: A Third Presence</h2>
    
      <p>The second structure is spiritual: the way religious solitude is lived as an event in a relationship with an unseen Other.</p>
    
      <p>In contemporary loneliness, the central feeling is often: <strong>no one sees me</strong>. Messages are left on read; invitations do not arrive; one’s presence seems to make little difference. Over time it is easy to drift toward a larger conviction that nothing in reality is especially concerned with one’s existence.</p>
    
      <p>Religious solitude, at least potentially, opens another possibility: that even when no human being is present, one still lives <strong>before a gaze</strong>. The names differ—God, the divine, ultimate reality—but structurally the claim is similar: there is an addressee whose regard matters.</p>
    
      <p>This is not just pious language. A recent cross-national study of five major religions in twenty-two countries found that people who believed that God cares about and loves them reported less loneliness and social isolation than those who did not, even after controlling for ordinary social support (Wormley et al.). The buffering effect of feeling cared for by God was especially strong among those who were objectively socially isolated (Wormley et al.).</p>
    
      <p>This does not mean that religious solitude is automatically comforting. Much religious literature centres on God’s silence, absence, or hiddenness. The crucial point is that this absence is still understood <strong>within</strong> a relationship frame: “Why are you silent?” “Why have you hidden your face?” The pain is interpreted as tension within a relationship, not as proof that no relationship exists.</p>
    
      <p>Spiritually, then, depth appears when the map of reality includes more than the visible social field. A person may still grieve the lack of human intimacy. But that grief is carried before a third presence who is addressed, accused, thanked, or simply acknowledged. “Nobody sees me” is no longer the final description of the situation.</p>

      <h2>6. Temporal Structure: Placing Loneliness in Long Stories</h2>
    
      <p>The third structure is temporal: how solitude is placed in time.</p>
    
      <p>As described earlier, contemporary loneliness often feels stuck in a <strong>sticky present</strong>. Yet another Friday passes with no plans; yet another night ends with a sore thumb and tired eyes. It is unclear when this state began, when it might end, or what it could possibly mean. The loneliness feels like evidence that one’s life has stalled.</p>
    
      <p>Religious solitude is usually embedded in <strong>thicker temporal patterns</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>On a small scale, there are daily and weekly rhythms: fixed times for prayer, meditation periods, services, fasts, and feasts. Being alone is not simply an accident or a mood; it is part of a schedule. A person withdraws to pray at set hours not because they feel lonely at that moment but because the community’s calendar calls them to it.</p>
    
      <p>On a larger scale, religious traditions name <strong>phases</strong> of the spiritual journey: the desert, the dark night, dryness, trial, hiddenness. Monastic and contemplative writers repeatedly describe periods when God feels distant, prayer feels empty, or old certainties fall apart (Merton). These phases are not interpreted as permanent verdicts but as recognisable stretches of the road. To say “I am in a desert time” is to place one’s experience in a shared map.</p>
    
      <p>On an even larger scale, solitude can be related to collective stories: creation and fall, exile and return, crucifixion and resurrection, enlightenment, liberation. A person’s loneliness can then be understood as participation in a shared drama: sharing in Christ’s abandonment, in the Buddha’s departure from the familiar, in the prophets’ estrangement from their society.</p>
    
      <p>These temporal structures do not make solitude feel good. But they do something crucial: they <strong>stretch it across time</strong>. Loneliness becomes something one is passing through, not a timeless label on one’s worth. It can be remembered, anticipated, and narrated. It acquires a before and an after.</p>

      <h2>7. Answering the Question: What Is the “Depth” of Religious Solitude?</h2>
    
      <p>We can now return to the research question. What constitutes the depth of religious solitude, and how does it differ from the shallow or fragmented forms of loneliness common in contemporary life? What psychological and spiritual structures make religious solitude a deeper, more meaningful way of being alone?</p>
    
      <p>The answer this essay proposes is that depth is <strong>not</strong> a mysterious extra ingredient possessed by religious people. It is a feature of a <strong>whole structure of life</strong>—psychological, spiritual, and temporal—that reshapes how loneliness is experienced.</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychologically</strong>, religious solitude keeps inner dialogue alive by reorganising inner speech as prayer and reflection, rather than letting it harden into muteness or simple self-attack (Arendt; Merton; Shiovitz-Ezra and Rozen).</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritually</strong>, it places the solitary person before a third presence, so that even experiences of abandonment are lived as tensions in a relationship, not as empty void (Wormley et al.).</li>
        <li><strong>Temporally</strong>, it embeds solitude in rhythms and stories that give it a before and after, allowing it to be named as a phase—desert, night, trial—rather than an endless, interchangeable series of nights (Merton).</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>By contrast, much contemporary loneliness—especially in digitised environments—has the opposite shape: inner speech turns against the self; the social world is experienced as an impersonal feed; and time shrinks to the length of a scroll. The pain is real, but it is structurally shallow, with few relationships, symbols, or stories to hold it.</p>
    
      <p>Religious solitude does not magically fix loneliness. It can be distorted, escapist, or unhealthy. But in its better forms, it does something important:</p>
    
      <blockquote>
        <p>It does not deny loneliness. It gives loneliness a place—in dialogue, before an Other, within a journey.</p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>The same basic fact—being without other people—can thus become either a shallow, repeated wound or a space in which a different kind of life slowly takes shape. The “depth” of religious solitude, then, is loneliness that has been taken seriously enough to be given <strong>relationships, language, and time</strong>.</p>
