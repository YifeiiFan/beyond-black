    <h2>3. What Do We Mean by “Depth”?</h2>

    <p>Before we turn to religious solitude, it helps to be clearer about the metaphor of depth itself.</p>
  
    <p>One mistake is to treat depth as a <strong>personal essence</strong>: some people are “deep,” others are superficial. Another is to equate depth with a particular mood—usually some mixture of sadness, seriousness, and introspection.</p>
  
    <p>Here, depth is understood not as a substance inside certain individuals but as a <strong>property of structure</strong>.</p>
  
    <p>An experience is deep when it is:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>relationally layered</strong> – it involves more than one relationship at once;</li>
      <li><strong>symbolically rich</strong> – it can be spoken about in more than one register (psychological, moral, spiritual, communal);</li>
      <li><strong>temporally extended</strong> – it can be placed not only in the moment but also in a personal story and in some larger narrative horizon.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>By contrast, an experience is shallow when it is confined to a single relational frame (“nobody needs me”), a narrow vocabulary (“I’m the problem”), and a thin sense of time (“this is just the way things are now”).</p>
  
    <p>Hannah Arendt offers a helpful distinction here. Writing about loneliness and totalitarianism, she distinguishes between <em>loneliness</em>, in which a person is deserted by others and by themselves, and <em>solitude</em>, in which a person can still carry on an inner dialogue—a “two-in-one” conversation with themselves (Arendt). The danger, for Arendt, is not simply being without others, but losing this inner companion.</p>
  
    <p>Many forms of religious solitude build on this two-in-one and add a third term. The solitary person does not only speak within themselves; they also address an Other—God, or some ultimate reality. The question “What should I do with my life?” is not only posed inward but also outward and upward. The structure becomes triadic: <strong>self – inner companion – divine addressee</strong>.</p>
  
    <p>This is one way in which depth begins to appear. The same felt loneliness is now connected simultaneously to oneself, to an inner dialogue, and to a third presence that is addressed, even if silently.</p>
