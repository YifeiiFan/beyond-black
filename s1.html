    <h2>1. What Kind of “Depth” Are We Talking About?</h2>

    <p>Many people know this difference intuitively. Two people are alone in their rooms. From the outside the scenes are almost identical: one body, one chair, a closed door. But from the inside they are not the same.</p>

    <p>In one room, the air feels thin. Time moves slowly. Thoughts spiral around the same questions: Why is no one answering me? Am I forgettable, unnecessary, already left behind?</p>

    <p>In the other room, the same physical solitude feels oddly full. The person is also alone and also quiet, but the silence is experienced as an opening: time to pray, to pay attention, to ask questions that cannot be asked in conversation. The experience may still hurt, but it feels oriented rather than directionless.</p>

    <p>This is more than just “religious people are more optimistic.” The real question is structural:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>What makes some experiences of being alone feel “deep,” while many forms of contemporary loneliness feel thin, fragmented, or simply painful?</p>
      <p>Why does religious solitude so often get described as richer and more generative than the usual psychological loneliness of modern life?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In contemporary psychology, <em>loneliness</em> is usually defined as the subjective feeling that one’s social needs are not being met, together with the distress that follows from this perception—a form of “social pain” (Cacioppo and Patrick). It is like hunger: a signal produced by systems that monitor how safely we are embedded in social life. Chronic loneliness keeps the brain in a state of alert and is linked to health problems across the body (Cacioppo and Patrick).</p>

    <p>Yet religious traditions often speak of <em>solitude</em> in very different terms. A person is just as alone, and yet that time is remembered as deep, meaningful, even necessary for their spiritual life.</p>

    <p>The basic claim of this essay is that the “depth” of religious solitude comes not from a special spiritual essence, but from the fact that it is placed inside a <strong>richer structure</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>a psychological structure</strong>, where inner dialogue is kept alive and organised as prayer or reflection rather than collapsing into self-attack;</li>
      <li><strong>a spiritual structure</strong>, where solitude is understood as happening before an unseen Other, not in a purely empty space;</li>
      <li><strong>a temporal structure</strong>, where solitude is embedded in long rhythms and stories, rather than treated as a meaningless gap between social events.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To see this more clearly, we can first sketch what contemporary loneliness often looks like.</p>
