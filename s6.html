    <h2>6. Temporal Structure: Placing Loneliness in Long Stories</h2>

    <p>The third structure is temporal: how solitude is placed in time.</p>
  
    <p>As described earlier, contemporary loneliness often feels stuck in a <strong>sticky present</strong>. Yet another Friday passes with no plans; yet another night ends with a sore thumb and tired eyes. It is unclear when this state began, when it might end, or what it could possibly mean. The loneliness feels like evidence that one’s life has stalled.</p>
  
    <p>Religious solitude is usually embedded in <strong>thicker temporal patterns</strong>.</p>
  
    <p>On a small scale, there are daily and weekly rhythms: fixed times for prayer, meditation periods, services, fasts, and feasts. Being alone is not simply an accident or a mood; it is part of a schedule. A person withdraws to pray at set hours not because they feel lonely at that moment but because the community’s calendar calls them to it.</p>
  
    <p>On a larger scale, religious traditions name <strong>phases</strong> of the spiritual journey: the desert, the dark night, dryness, trial, hiddenness. Monastic and contemplative writers repeatedly describe periods when God feels distant, prayer feels empty, or old certainties fall apart (Merton). These phases are not interpreted as permanent verdicts but as recognisable stretches of the road. To say “I am in a desert time” is to place one’s experience in a shared map.</p>
  
    <p>On an even larger scale, solitude can be related to collective stories: creation and fall, exile and return, crucifixion and resurrection, enlightenment, liberation. A person’s loneliness can then be understood as participation in a shared drama: sharing in Christ’s abandonment, in the Buddha’s departure from the familiar, in the prophets’ estrangement from their society.</p>
  
    <p>These temporal structures do not make solitude feel good. But they do something crucial: they <strong>stretch it across time</strong>. Loneliness becomes something one is passing through, not a timeless label on one’s worth. It can be remembered, anticipated, and narrated. It acquires a before and an after.</p>
